              <h3>Intro</h3>
                <div class="notes">The web basically consists of four general elements: <em>browsers</em>
                 (with their usually human users), <em>hypertext markup language (HTML)</em>,
                 <em>hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)</em>, and <em>servers</em>.
                </div>
              <h3>Browsers</h3>
                <div class="notes"><a href="http://www.chrome.com" target=_blank >Chrome</a>,
                  <a href="http://www.firefox.com" target=_blank>Firefox</a>,
                  <a href="http://www.internetexplorer.com" target=_blank>Internet Explorer</a>, etc.
                  Everyone knows what these are! They're how users access and interact with html docs.
                </div>
              <h3>HTML</h3>
                <div class="notes">This stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the basis for
                  the type of documents most often encountered on the web.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-2">
              <h3>HTTP</h3>
                <div class="notes">Which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the protocol
                  that allows communication between servers and browsers, so that
                  servers know which documents to send to browsers.
                </div>
              <h3>Servers</h3>
                <div class="notes">Servers are just computers that are optimized not for interaction
                  with users but rather for storage.
                </div>

        <h2>Stage 1: Oh, I Get It</h2>
          <div class="stage">
            <div class="concept-1">
              <h3>Learning</h3>
                <div class="notes">Learning is a continuum from novice to expertise. Four stages are:
                  <em>ignorance</em>, <em>awareness</em>, <em>ability</em>, and <em>fluency</em>. Ability to fluency is the hardest, longest stage. We're shooting for Ability in some
                  topics and Awareness in many others. Frustration is inevitable; you
                  should always ask for help, take a break, and/or just keep going.
                  <p>Reading code you don't understand: hard but fruitful. Use <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">google</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>.
                  </p>
                </div>
              <h3>Making a Web Page</h3>
                <div class="notes">I'm gonna do that. Try, fail, succeed.
                  <p><em>Front-end web development</em>: all you do is visible (Python e.g. is not,
                  so it's hard to share).
                </div>
              <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
                <div class="notes"><em>Document Object Model</em> (DOM) is the tree-like structure of a
                  page. "a cross-platform and language-independent convention for
                  representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other
                  markup languages. The nodes of every document are organized in a
                  tree structure, called the DOM tree."
                </div>
              <h3>Boxes and Boxifying</h3>
                <div class="notes">Everything front-end is boxes, so it's efficient to think of the
                  page that way. Boxify is a word for when you take someone's
                  mockup/pdf of a page and determine the number/placement of
                  boxes you'd need for the code.
                  <p>CSS is used for style, so the ex is if you're moving, html = the
                  boxes you put your stuff in and css = the instructions you write
                  on them ('goes in kitchen' or 'handle with care').
                  </p>
                </div>
              <h3>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>
                <div class="notes">Websites qua house: html is structure (walls, rooms), css are style
                  of house (carpeting color, wall colors), javascript are
                  interactive components (tv remote, garage door opener). Webtools
                  too (screwdriver).
                </div>

            </div>
            <div class="concept-2">
              <h3>Chrome Developer Tools</h3>
                <div class="notes">Chrome->tools->dev tools (wikipedia), shows not code itself but
                  rather structure of page as browser interprets the code; you can
                  get down to the code, though, including plain text.
                  <p>Changing stuff in dev mode is displayed then in the lefthand panel
                  to show you what would change there. Style of html stuff is
                  shown below in another window.
                  </p>
                  <p><em>HTML</em> ->language-> syntax and rules; each tag is like a word in html
                  language, or they're elements in tree. tags can have attributes
                  (class, href, etc.);
                  </p>
                  <p><em>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</em> allows you to use syntax and rules to
                  change look of page; in CSS, unchecking "border radius 50%"
                  changes circles to squares.
                  </p>
                </div>
              <h3>CSS and Style Modeling</h3>
                <div class="notes">You must link from html doc to css in order to apply style to your
                  page--in this example it was making the <em>description</em> part
                  of your page red.
                  <p><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>: imagine like national, state, municipal,
                  house laws. But here, the most specific rule (house rule, here)
                  gets applied to every element--it cascades up to national, that is.
                  <p><em>Selector</em> = what a style on page gets applied to. Font can be normal,
                  italic, and oblique. Font-weight light(er) or bold(er).
                </div>
              <h3>Best Practices for Coding Style</h3>
                <div class="notes">Consistent indentation levels is crucial! The pre tag preserves any
                  formatting present within its elements. Use double quotes. Use
                  comments to clarify where a big div ends, for example, but in
                  general use comments sparingly. The structure of your code
                  should make your intentions obvious and comments unnecessary.
                  Try to find the shortest link for a URL. In CSS, keep one
                  attribute and one value per line, and keep attributes indented
                  to same level.
                  <p>Boxes are stylistically made up of: content, padding, border,
                  and margins. By default, the width of a box is the sum of the
                  content, padding, and border values.</p>
                  <p><em>Flex boxes</em> control positioning of boxes: add flex to value of size
                  attribute.</p>
                </div>
              <h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3>
                <div class="notes">
                  <ol>
                    <li>Look for natural boxes;</li>
                    <li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements;</li>
                    <li>Write your HTML;</li>
                    <li>Apply styles (from biggest to smallest);</li>
                    <li>Fix things!</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
          </div>
    </body>
